# ðŸ§¬ Germline Variant Comparison Summary (SRR32583844 vs SRR32583845)

High-impact germline variants from healthy (SRR32583844) and tumor (SRR32583845) samples were compared following GATK HaplotypeCaller and Ensembl VEP annotation.

## Summary

- Tumor-only high-impact mutated genes: 69
- Healthy-only high-impact mutated genes: 86
- Shared high-impact genes: 21

## Tumor-Specific Germline Variants

Genes such as SNAP47, UBXN11, and RASAL1 were observed exclusively in the tumor sample:

- SNAP47: involved in vesicle trafficking and synaptic signaling
- UBXN11: linked to protein degradation and cell cycle regulation
- RASAL1: tumor suppressor in Ras signaling pathway

These variants may reflect inherited susceptibility or early-onset genomic instability in cancer-prone tissue.

##Healthy-Specific Germline Variants

Genes such as ATXN3, IL32, and EXO5 appeared only in the healthy sample:

- ATXN3: neurodegeneration-linked gene, with polymorphic repeats
- IL32: immune modulator involved in inflammation
- EXO5: component of the DNA repair machinery

These variants are likely benign or non-pathogenic background polymorphisms common in non-tumor tissue.

##Shared High-Impact Genes

MUC19, OBSCN, CRYBG2, and VDR were mutated in both samples, though often with increased counts in the tumor sample:

- MUC19 and OBSCN: structural and mucin genes with barrier defense roles
- CRYBG2 and VDR: involved in cellular stress responses and vitamin D signaling

This suggests clonal expansion or selection for certain germline variants in the tumor environment.

##Conclusion

Germline analysis identified distinct mutation profiles in the healthy and tumor genomes. The tumor sample harbored high-impact variants in genes related to cell signaling, degradation, and potential oncogenic predisposition. In contrast, the healthy sample featured immune-regulatory and DNA-repair polymorphisms. Shared variants suggest selective expansion or enrichment in tumor development, offering candidate genes for future screening or risk assessment in oral cancers.
